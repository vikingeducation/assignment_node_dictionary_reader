### Assignment description:

Build a simple dictionary search tool on the command-line. The main goal is to split up the responsibility of tasks amongst a handful of different modules.

The main tasks of the application are:

1. CLI user interface: user prompting, acceptance of user input, error reporting and display  
2. Loading: loading a dictionary file and keeping track of dictionary files available for loading  
3. Saving: writing search results to a file and avoiding overwriting the default dictionary.json file or user created dictionary files  
4. Searching: searching the currently loaded dictionary based on user input  
5. Dictionary data: the wrapper for the loaded dictionary data, used for accessing the JSON data as well as statistics about the data
